The world around her seemed to transform, revealing hidden wonders that had always remained unseen. With each step she took, the backpack seemed to adapt to her needs, becoming lighter when she felt weary and expanding to accommodate her numerous textbooks.\n",

Another time, she visited a medieval castle, where she met a wise old wizard who shared his secrets with her.\n",
